# CaiBot

This is a hobby project about twitch chat moderation which turned out much larger than expected...

You can find more about the bot on my [twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/caisesiume/about)

This page is where you will be able to find the rebuilt & better version of the currently running bot.

For now, you can find all commands and similar in the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/Caisesiume/CaiBot/wiki/Home).

Some bot features to be implemented:

* Chat moderation
* [Commands](https://github.com/Caisesiume/CaiBot/wiki/Commands)
* Custom commands
* [Custom channel point rewards](https://github.com/Caisesiume/CaiBot/wiki/Channel-Point-Rewards)

## Technical info
The bot is node.js based(12.x) and connects to twitch using the Twitch.js API.

By using 'npm install' you install all the needed node modules.

In order to use this bot, you will have to get your bot account's tokens and clients.
Swap the placeholders in tokens.json and client.json with your real ones.

When you set up the authorization part, you can simply use 'npm start' to start the bot.

The current state of the bot is sort of limited. It has a few cool features that works but it's not at all free from issues, just a heads up.
