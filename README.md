# CaiBot

This is a hobby project about twitch chat moderation which turned out much larger than expected...

You can find more about the bot on my [twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/caisesiume/about)

Some bot features:
* Chat moderation
* Commands
* Custom commands
## Technical info
The bot is node.js based and connects to twitch using the Twitch.js API.

I am kind of a noob with some coding parts, so a lot of the code will probably be questionable in terms of how it's written.
