# CaiBot

This is a hobby project about twitch chat moderation which turned out much larger than expected...

You can find more about the bot on my [twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/caisesiume/about)

This page is where you will be able to find the rebuilt & better version of the currently running bot.


Some bot features to be implemented:

* Chat moderation
* [Commands](https://github.com/Caisesiume/CaiBot/wiki/Commands)
* Custom commands
* [Custom channel point rewards](https://github.com/Caisesiume/CaiBot/wiki/Channel-Point-Rewards)

## Technical info
The bot is node.js based and connects to twitch using the Twitch.js API.

In order to use this bot, you will have to get your bots tokens and clients. 
The current state of the bot is not useful at all, just FYI.


I am kind of a noob with some coding parts, so a lot of the code will probably be questionable in terms of how it's written.
